# Notes

## BM
- twilio routes use operator mobile number as opposed to my number, hardcoded

## Nice-to-haves
- add functionality to /sms route so texts sent to Twilio number are forwarded to operator
- spinner or display nothing while data loading
- make modals more responsive (difficult to read on large screens, some clipping on tablet size)
