# Notes

## Trevor

- ES6 Module Syntax rather than require
- constant values should be LIKE_THIS
- constant should be in own file and imported
- prettier settings
  - keep brackets around single param arrow funcs
  - allow more arguments before putting each on own line
  - don't omit braces on multiline ifs
- for true/false returns, reformat
- concantenate errors in inserts and queries
- remove unused imports or at least comment them out
- (\_, res) when you don't need the first parameter
- menu item modal, limited description length
- modal text size
- spinner and display nothing while data loading
- no transparency on nav on tablet and under
