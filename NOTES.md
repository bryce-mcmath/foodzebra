# Notes

## BM
- no transparency on nav on tablet and under
- remove Events and Hours from nav, add either Register and Login or just Logout based on state
- add functionality to /sms route so texts sent to Twilio number are forwarded to operator
- register and login is only for operators
- add "Demo" to brand
- twilio routes use operator mobile number as opposed to my number, hardcoded
- BEM

## Stuff to Deal With On Monday

- fix state issue where things don't update. Immutability issue?
- spinner or display nothing while data loading
